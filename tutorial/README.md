# Day 000 - Introduction  
The goal of this project is to build a DOOM clone engine. An engine that uses the assets released with Ultimate DOOM ([steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/Ultimate_Doom/)).  
This will be in a tutorial form, I'm not looking to squeeze performance with my code, I hope to get a working version and later tune and optimize it.  

Before we go on, I have no experience in building games or game engines, also I have little experience with writing articles, so you're welcome to suggest changes or even re-write it.  

Here is a list of resources and references.  
[Game Engine Black Book: DOOM by Fabien Sanglard](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Black-Book-Doom/dp/1987418433)  
This is one of the best books that dive into DOOM internals.

### Requirements  
* Visual Studio: Any IDE should work; I will use Visual Studio 2017.  
* SDL2: Libraries.  
* DOOM: A copy of Ultimate DOOM steam version, we will only need the WAD file.  

### Optional  
* Slade3: This will be a good tool to verify some of our work.  

### Thoughts  
~~I don't know if I can complete this project, but I will try my best.~~ I always believe I can.  
Thanks to __DOOMReboot__ who has offered to help in this project, he has good experience building a doom engine from scratch, and he will be a valuable asset!  
My target platform will be windows, but since we I'm using SDL, it should be easy to get this to work under other platforms.  
For now, install Visual Studio!

If you find errors/bugs please report them, I will credit you by adding your name at the top of the article.
