# Week 016 - Portals
Now it is time to talk about the second type of walls, Portals, or as I like to call them "Windows".  

Before explaining what Portals are, let's recap a few things about solid walls.  
* Solid walls are one-sided Linedefs (you are not supposed to go behind them).
* Once a solid wall is drawn at an X location on the screen, nothing else can be drawn on top of that.  
* A solid wall has three parts, ceiling, the solid wall itself (which now we will start calling Middle Section), and the floor.  
  
So, what are Portals? Portals are walls with an opening where you can see through them. They can look like a passageway, a see-through barrier (like grating if a texture is provided), and a step and/or decrease in ceiling height.

![Portals](./img/portal.png)  
  
There are two types of Portals, ones that you can see through, and ones you can partially see through.   
Portals are parts of a Sector (a sector consists of all connected, surrounding Seg)s. A Sector defines the ceilings and floors; a Sector defines both heights and textures of both ceilings and floors).

![Walls](./img/walls.png)  

Notice the top and bottom section of the Portal are not see-through.  

Top view

The main difference between see-through Portals and partial see-through Portals, is the see-through part has a middle texture.  
If you don't know me by now, simplicity is the key to understanding, so forget about the partial see-through walls and let’s assume that all Portals are just see-through (we will just ignore the middle texture).  

So, with that simplification it should be easy to draw a Portal. It's similar to drawing solid walls, but instead of drawing one single solid wall (middle section), let's draw two solid sections: the top and bottom sections. We will not draw anything for the middle, but there is a catch!  

Portals can be identified by having both a front Sector and a back Sector (since we see through the wall, we need to know some information about the floor and ceiling on the other side of the Portal).  
In a single-sided Linedef (a solid wall), a single Seg is created which only has a front side, but two Segs are created for a two-sided Linedef, one for the front and one for the back. That means when we try to draw a Seg we must know if it is running along the front Sector or the back Sector. This is where the direction flag in the Seg data becomes handy. The direction flag indicates the type (direction) of the Seg.  

Original/Chocolate Doom had a nice trick, it checks the direction flag and switches the front and the back, so let’s "borrow" that trick.
In the function ```void Map::BuildSeg()```  

``` cpp
    Sidedef *pFrontSidedef;
    Sidedef *pBackSidedef;

    if (seg.Direction)
    {
        pFrontSidedef = seg.pLinedef->pBackSidedef;
        pBackSidedef = seg.pLinedef->pFrontSidedef;
    }
    else
    {
        pFrontSidedef = seg.pLinedef->pFrontSidedef;
        pBackSidedef = seg.pLinedef->pBackSidedef;
    }
```
Note: I just noticed I pushed the above code in an earlier week, it should have been pushed this week with the explanation.  

With the first issue out of the way, there is another issue we need to handle: maintaining ceiling and floor height. Imagine drawing a Portal (top section and/or bottom section). As you are drawing Segs you need to draw what is behind them.  
 
From the previous week, did you notice that the four pillars look taller than how they look in the original DOOM?  

![Wall top](./img/screen1.png)  

This is due to the ceiling and floors of the Segs that are in front of and behind the clipped Seg (in other words, there is a ceiling or a floor that blocks you from seeing this). 
The following animation shows the ceiling and the floor for the Segs where the player spawns (those ceilings and floors are not clipping each other).

![No Clip](./img/no_clip.gif)  

Looking at the same problem from the Portal's point of view, Portals are see-through, so you have to draw what is behind it, but we are drawing everything from near to far away. So, we need to keep track of where we can draw on the screen (from the top and the bottom).  
We will have two vectors that will keep track of every Y height for every X on the screen.

``` cpp
    std::vector<int> m_FloorClipHeight;
    std::vector<int> m_CeilingClipHeight;
```

and on initialization 
``` cpp
    // m_iRenderXSize = 320
    m_CeilingClipHeight.resize(m_iRenderXSize);
    m_FloorClipHeight.resize(m_iRenderXSize);
```

on each frame start we will set them all to their minimum values

``` cpp
    std::fill(m_CeilingClipHeight.begin(), m_CeilingClipHeight.end(), -1);
    std::fill(m_FloorClipHeight.begin(), m_FloorClipHeight.end(), m_iRenderYSize);
```

Now, while we are drawing Segs we should update those two vectors.

Let’s jump to the code and explain what's happening as we go.

## Goals
* Refactoring
* Clip ceilings and floors
* Draw Portals

## Code
First things first, clean up! I noticed that I have been passing a lot of parameters around, so I grouped them up in a struct and just pass a pointer to that struct.

``` cpp
struct FrameRenderData
    {
        float DistanceToV1;
        float DistanceToNormal;
        float V1ScaleFactor;
        float V2ScaleFactor;
        float Steps;

        float FrontSectorCeiling;
        float FrontSectorFloor;
        float CeilingStep;
        float CeilingEnd;
        float FloorStep;
        float FloorStart;

        float BackSectorCeiling;
        float BackSectorFloor;

        bool bDrawUpperSection;
        bool bDrawLowerSection;

        float UpperHeightStep;
        float iUpperHeight;
        float LowerHeightStep;
        float iLowerHeight;

        bool UpdateFloor;
        bool UpdateCeiling;
    };
```

Now, we should start processing Portal Segs. Since we used such a check ```if (seg.pBackSector == nullptr)``` to determine a solid Seg you would expect everything to be a Portal Seg. However, that is not the case. One case is when doors are Portals, so we want to handle them in a special way!
So, one alternative is to check if the there is a change in ceiling or floor height between the front and back Sector (after all, that is what makes a wall a Portal, a difference between these two heights).


``` cpp
    // function AddWallInFOV
    // Windowed walls
    if (seg.pFrontSector->CeilingHeight != seg.pBackSector->CeilingHeight ||
        seg.pFrontSector->FloorHeight != seg.pBackSector->FloorHeight)
    {
        ClipPassWalls(seg, V1XScreen, V2XScreen, V1Angle, V2Angle);
        return;
    }
```

Now, what we want to do when we detect that a Seg is Portal, is to find out if a solid wall already fills in that area (remember, once a solid wall is there you can't draw anything over it). We have a function that does this for us ```ClipSolidWalls```, but there is a little problem if we decide to use the same function. The function will think the Seg we are passing in is a solid wall and will fill the area that is supposed to be a Portal, which is something we don't want to do. One solution to this problem is to change ```ClipSolidWalls``` to ```ClipPassWalls``` and simply remove the code that stores the Seg. So, both functions are the same implementation, but removing any insert or delete to the ```m_SolidWallRanges``` vector.

``` cpp
void ViewRenderer::ClipPassWalls(Seg &seg, int V1XScreen, int V2XScreen, Angle V1Angle, Angle V2Angle)
{
    ....
}
```

Now, after we know that the partial Seg could possibly be drawn in that area we will require some flags to help us decide of what to keep track.

This is where the function ```CeilingFloorUpdate(RenderData, seg);``` comes into play.

``` cpp
void ViewRenderer::CeilingFloorUpdate(ViewRenderer::FrameRenderData &RenderData, Seg & seg)
{
    // Is it a solid wall?
    if (!seg.pBackSector)
    {
        RenderData.UpdateCeiling = true;
        RenderData.UpdateFloor = true;
        return;
    }

    // Is there difference in ceiling height?
    if (RenderData.BackSectorCeiling != RenderData.FrontSectorCeiling)
    {
        RenderData.UpdateCeiling = true;
    }
    else
    {
        RenderData.UpdateCeiling = false;
    }

    // Is there difference in floor height?
    if (RenderData.BackSectorFloor != RenderData.FrontSectorFloor)
    {
        RenderData.UpdateFloor = true;
    }
    else
    {
        RenderData.UpdateFloor = false;
    }

    // Is this a closed door?
    if (seg.pBackSector->CeilingHeight <= seg.pFrontSector->FloorHeight || seg.pBackSector->FloorHeight >= seg.pFrontSector->CeilingHeight)
    {
        RenderData.UpdateCeiling = RenderData.UpdateFloor = true;
    }

    // Is the ceiling below the player? (ceiling is always above you)
    if (seg.pFrontSector->CeilingHeight <= m_pPlayer->GetZPosition())
    {
        RenderData.UpdateCeiling = false;
    }

    // Is the floor above the player? (floor is always below you)
    if (seg.pFrontSector->FloorHeight >= m_pPlayer->GetZPosition())
    {
        // above view plane
        RenderData.UpdateFloor = false;
    }
}
```

Now, we need to update our ```CalculateWallHeight``` to handle the back Sector. If you remember, it already handles the front Sector from the previous week.
These are similar calculations as to what we have done on the front Sector.

``` cpp
void ViewRenderer::CalculateWallHeight(Seg &seg, int V1XScreen, int V2XScreen, Angle V1Angle, Angle V2Angle)
{
    ...

    if (seg.pBackSector)
    {
        RenderData.BackSectorCeiling = seg.pBackSector->CeilingHeight - m_pPlayer->GetZPosition();
        RenderData.BackSectorFloor = seg.pBackSector->FloorHeight - m_pPlayer->GetZPosition();

        CeilingFloorUpdate(RenderData, seg);

        // Is the Ceiling visible?
        if (RenderData.BackSectorCeiling < RenderData.FrontSectorCeiling)
        {
            RenderData.bDrawUpperSection = true;
            RenderData.UpperHeightStep = -(RenderData.BackSectorCeiling * RenderData.Steps);
            RenderData.iUpperHeight = round(m_HalfScreenHeight - (RenderData.BackSectorCeiling * RenderData.V1ScaleFactor));
        }

        // Is the floor visible
        if (RenderData.BackSectorFloor > RenderData.FrontSectorFloor)
        {
            RenderData.bDrawLowerSection = true;
            RenderData.LowerHeightStep = -(RenderData.BackSectorFloor * RenderData.Steps);
            RenderData.iLowerHeight = round(m_HalfScreenHeight - (RenderData.BackSectorFloor * RenderData.V1ScaleFactor));
        }
    }

    RenderSegment(seg, V1XScreen, V2XScreen, RenderData);
}
```

Now, with the drawing function cleaned up, the drawing of upper and lower sections is basically the same. The drawing of the middle section is also very similar.
The only problem I faced was within the ```SelectColor``` function, within the while loop (to have different colors for the top and bottom sections). The rendering was extremely slow. The function ```SDL_SetRenderDrawColor``` is very time-consuming. We will investigate fixing this next week but, for now, let’s set both the upper and lower sections of each Portal to same color.  

``` cpp
void ViewRenderer::RenderSegment(Seg &seg, int V1XScreen, int V2XScreen, FrameRenderData &RenderData)
{
    SDL_Color color;
    int iXCurrent;

    iXCurrent = V1XScreen;

    SelectColor(seg, color);

    while (iXCurrent <= V2XScreen)
    {
        int CurrentCeilingEnd = RenderData.CeilingEnd;
        int CurrentFloorStart = RenderData.FloorStart;

        // Validate with the height of ceiling and floor is within range
        if (!ValidateRange(RenderData, iXCurrent, CurrentCeilingEnd, CurrentFloorStart))
        {
            continue;
        }

        // Is it a Portal?
        if (seg.pBackSector)
        {
            DrawUpperSection(RenderData, iXCurrent, CurrentCeilingEnd);
            DrawLowerSection(RenderData, iXCurrent, CurrentFloorStart);
        }
        else
        {
            // It is solid
            DrawMiddleSection(iXCurrent, CurrentCeilingEnd, CurrentFloorStart);
        }

        RenderData.CeilingEnd += RenderData.CeilingStep;
        RenderData.FloorStart += RenderData.FloorStep;
        ++iXCurrent;
    }
}
```

There is a nice optimization in the code, handle closed doors as a solid wall

``` cpp
    // AddWallInFOV
    // Handle closed door
    if (seg.pBackSector->CeilingHeight <= seg.pFrontSector->FloorHeight
        || seg.pBackSector->FloorHeight >= seg.pFrontSector->CeilingHeight)
    {
        ClipSolidWalls(seg, V1XScreen, V2XScreen, V1Angle, V2Angle);
        return;
    }
```

One final thing, let’s give the player a way to raise and lower their altitude so that we can fly around the map using the Z and X buttons.

``` cpp
void Player::Fly()
{
    m_ZPosition += 1;
}

void Player::Sink()
{
    m_ZPosition -= 1;
}
```

Now run

Now moving around

It unbelievable that simply handling those two types of walls renders the Mission, it is very impressive to see a 2D map transform into a 3D view this way. It makes me wonder how they came up with this back in 1993.  
All those ceilings and floors that are drawn in black are known as Visplanes. But, those are for an upcoming week.
What I would like to do now is to give the DOOM guy proper walking code. You may have noticed that his Z coordinate doesn't change when he goes up or down stairs.

## Other Notes
The above code is implemented in the original Chocolate DOOM in r_segs.c, R_StoreWallRange, and r_main.c. This is just part of what this function does.
Drawing Portals was easier than I had expected. It may sound complex at the beginning, but if you break it down and go slow it should be easy to understand
